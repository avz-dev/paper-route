A series of billboards will give the player a brief introduction to the game's systems. 

`WASD` allows the player to move about the play area.  
`Space` or `Left-Click` allow the player to throw paper.

The amount of money earned with each paper will be determined by the zone it lands in. The *lawn* earns **5¢**, the *walkway* earns **10¢**,  and the *doorstep* earns **25¢**.

Obstacles in the road will incur a movement penalty when hit and should be avoided by the player.

`Esc` allows the player to pause at any time.

Holding down `Space` or `Left-Click` will prompt a power meter to appear. While held down, the power meter will alternate from low to high power. Releasing `Space` or `Left-Click` will launch a paper toward the top of the screen with its velocity determined by the power meter.

Each route consists of 30 houses and 30 papers to distribute. Following each route, the player will encounter a shop where they can choose to spend their money on bike upgrades or progression to the next level. The option of going on another route to earn more money is also available.

Purchasing the next level will change the season, introducing new obstacles and visuals. The cost of each new level will increase as the player progresses.
